**1. A Data Structure for Integrity Protection with Erasure Capability (data block matrix)**

**Q1.** In “A Data Structure for Integrity Protection with Erasure Capability,” what is the main purpose of the data block matrix, and what limitation of traditional permissioned blockchains is it addressing?

**A1.** The data block matrix is a hash-linked data structure designed to keep integrity guarantees while still allowing arbitrary records to be deleted. It directly addresses the usual limitation of permissioned blockchains, where hash chaining makes deletion difficult, by supporting ongoing insertion of new blocks while enabling removal of specific blocks without breaking integrity for the remaining data.

**Q2.** Why is the ability to delete arbitrary records in the data block matrix considered useful, and which regulation is cited as a motivating example?

**A2.** Deletion is important because some privacy rules require organizations to erase all data related to a particular individual on request. The document specifically mentions the EU General Data Protection Regulation as an example of such a requirement, and the matrix is proposed as a way to offer integrity protection in systems that must still comply with that kind of erasure obligation.

**2. A Methodology for Developing Authentication Assurance Level Taxonomy for Smart Card-based Identity Verification (NISTIR 7849)**

**Q3.** According to the abstract of NISTIR 7849, what is the limitation of assigning authentication strength simply by counting “what you know / what you have / what you are” factors, and what alternative basis for measuring authentication strength is proposed?

**A3.** The report notes that just counting factors and their entropy ignores how the underlying credentials are bound together, and therefore does not capture many realistic threats to smart card use. Instead, it proposes measuring authentication strength according to the strength of pairwise bindings among key elements associated with the smart identity token (such as the token secret, the cardholder, the issuer, and the stored person identifier) and how many of those bindings are actually verified in a given use case.

**3. A Survey of Remote Monitoring**

**Q4.** In “A Survey of Remote Monitoring,” which application areas for remote monitoring are highlighted in the abstract?

**A4.** The abstract states that remote monitoring is used in performance evaluation, diagnostic testing, performance assurance, and system security testing. These four application areas frame the later discussion and examples in the report.

**Q5.** How does the survey describe the way remote monitors are organized conceptually?

**A5.** It explains that remote monitors are grouped into seven classes. For each class, the report discusses example systems and their capabilities across the application areas just mentioned, after briefly reviewing how remote monitoring has evolved.

**4. A Zero Trust Architecture Model for Access Control in Cloud-Native Applications in Multi-Cloud Environments (NIST SP 800-207A)**

**Q6.** What basic tenet of zero trust is emphasized in the abstract of NIST SP 800-207A, and what shift does it imply compared to traditional perimeter-based security?

**A6.** The abstract emphasizes removing implicit trust based solely on network location, affiliation, or ownership. Instead of treating things inside a network boundary as inherently more trustworthy, it shifts access decisions to be based on identities and contextual attributes, so that users, services, and devices must be continuously authenticated and authorized regardless of where they are running.

**Q7.** Which platform components does the abstract say are needed to enforce zero-trust policies for cloud-native applications across multiple environments?

**A7.** It calls for a platform that combines API gateways, sidecar proxies, and application identity infrastructure, explicitly mentioning frameworks like SPIFFE. These components are expected to enforce identity-centric policies consistently whether services run on premises or in multiple clouds.

**5. Addressing Visibility Challenges with TLS 1.3 within the Enterprise (NIST SP 1800-37, High-Level Document)**

**Q8.** How does TLS 1.3’s use of forward secrecy affect enterprises’ existing approaches to traffic decryption and visibility, according to the abstract?

**A8.** TLS 1.3’s design makes past session keys unusable even if a server’s long-term key is later compromised, which is the property known as forward secrecy. The abstract notes that the way TLS 1.3 accomplishes this can interfere with the passive decryption techniques enterprises rely on for inspecting internal TLS 1.2 traffic, reducing their ability to monitor encrypted communications in the same way.

**Q9.** Why do enterprises depend on visibility into TLS traffic, as described in this document?

**A9.** It explains that authorized security staff use visibility into TLS traffic to operate critical cybersecurity controls that protect organizational data and systems, and to satisfy operational needs and legal or regulatory obligations. Losing that visibility can therefore weaken monitoring and compliance capabilities.

**6. An Introduction to Information Security (NIST SP 800-12 Rev. 1)**

**Q10.** What is the main objective of NIST SP 800-12 Rev. 1 as stated in its abstract?

**A10.** The publication aims to introduce core information security principles that organizations can use to understand what their systems need in terms of protection. It situates those principles within a broader context of risk management, security controls, and security requirements so that organizations can better align their security measures with the way they use information technology.

**Q11.** The keywords for SP 800-12 include several broad themes. Name at least three of them.

**A11.** Among the listed keywords are “assurance,” “computer security,” “information security,” “risk management,” “security controls,” and “security requirements.” Any three of these themes are acceptable.

**7. Annual Report 2018: NIST/ITL Cybersecurity Program (NIST SP 800-206)**

**Q12.** Based on the introductory material of NIST SP 800-206, what role does the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) play in relation to cybersecurity and the nation’s standards infrastructure?

**A12.** The report describes ITL as providing technical leadership for the nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. In the cybersecurity context, that role involves developing tests, methods, reference data, proof-of-concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the secure and productive use of information technology across the economy and the public sector.

**8. Approaches for Federal Agencies to Use the Cybersecurity Framework (NISTIR 8170)**

**Q13.** According to the abstract of NISTIR 8170, how is the Cybersecurity Framework intended to complement other NIST standards and guidelines for federal agencies?

**A13.** The document explains that the Cybersecurity Framework is meant to be applied alongside other NIST security and privacy risk-management standards, such as the Risk Management Framework and related publications. Used together, these resources form a comprehensive, risk-based approach that helps agencies manage cybersecurity and privacy risks throughout the system lifecycle.

**Q14.** Which law and Executive Order are explicitly mentioned as being supported by the comprehensive risk-based approach described in this report?

**A14.** It points to the Federal Information Security Management/Modernization Act (FISMA) and Executive Order 13800. The examples in the document show how applying the Framework together with NIST risk-management guidance assists agencies in meeting their obligations under those authorities.

**9. Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems and Organizations (NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 5)**

**Q15.** What does SP 800-53A Rev. 5 provide, according to its abstract, and how are its procedures intended to be used across the system development life cycle?

**A15.** The abstract states that SP 800-53A offers a methodology and concrete procedures for assessing security and privacy controls in systems and organizations as part of a broader risk-management framework. These procedures are aligned with the controls in SP 800-53 Rev. 5 and are meant to be applied at multiple phases of the system development life cycle, with tailoring to match each organization’s risk tolerance and to support creation of effective assessment plans and analysis of results.

**10. Audit and Evaluation of Computer Security (NBS Special Publication 500-19)**

**Q16.** What was the purpose of the workshop reported in “Audit and Evaluation of Computer Security,” and what kinds of topics did its ten sessions cover?

**A16.** The workshop was convened to explore the state of the art in auditing and evaluating computer security and to identify promising areas for future research. According to the abstract, its ten sessions each focused on a different aspect, including internal audit standards, qualifications and training, security administration, audit considerations for different system environments, administrative and physical controls, program integrity, data integrity, communications, and both post-processing and interactive audit tools and techniques.
